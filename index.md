## About Me

My name is GREENJ, and I'm pursuing a degree in Computer science

I eventually finished my c++ class, and my last assignemnt was to create this page and add one final project to it

We've had many options on what to put here: Github, Raylib, Twine, RPG Maker (?)
I chose to use bitsy, becuase I had a splendid idea while at work
